'''
To properly detect refugee settlments high res sat imagery is required. Below
is a list of resources that can provide the quality of imagery needed:

google earth engine (https://earthengine.google.com/)
orbview 3 (https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/satellite_orbview3)
very high res or high res imagery from geoimage
    (https://www.geoimage.com.au/satellites/very-high-resolution-satellites)
    this option requires funds


NASA's GHRSST might have high enough radiometer imagery to pick out
    heat signitures for blob detection(https://search.earthdata.nasa.
    gov/search?q=high%20resolution&ok=high%20resolution)
